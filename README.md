The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

Under /project-01 The WorldCupMatches.csv dataset, which contains thorough records of football games from several World Cup competitions, was the subject of my exploratory data research. My main goal was to condense the data and produce visualizations that would highlight intriguing trends or patterns.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

Under /project-02 I examine the Social Security Administrationâ€™s examination of infant names. From 1880 through 2020, all names with at least 5 occurrences in a single year are included in the dataset.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 03

Under /project-03 I examine the the data provided by the Tampa International Airport to recreate graphs that were based on the 2016 but now with the 2022 dataset.

### Moving Forward

There is still a lot to learn as the samples provided above are not perfect. There is always a way to tell a data story differently and so that it can be understood by more than just me. Reproducing and/or creating visualizations based on other that I see will be a big topic of research in the future.
